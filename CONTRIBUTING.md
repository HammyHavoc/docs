# Contributing

If you want to make the VersionPress documentation better, there are two good ways:

 1. [Report an issue / suggest an improvement](https://github.com/versionpress/docs/issues).
 2. Fork the repo, make edits and send us a pull request. You'll want to read [this wiki page](https://github.com/versionpress/docs/wiki).

Thank you!

# Merging Sites #


This process creates a merges changes made in [a clone](./merging) to the original site. 

VersionPress supports two methods of merging â€“ either from command line using WP-CLI or from the admin pages ("GUI" method).


## WP-CLI method ##

This method merges a clone into the original site from command line using WP-CLI. You need to have [WP-CLI installed and working](../feature-focus/wp-cli) on your computer / server. 


Merging is executed from the root of your cloned site like this:

    wp vp push

This will apply all changes made in the clone to the original site.


## GUI method ##

To be implemented

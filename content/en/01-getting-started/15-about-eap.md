# About EAP

Early Access Program (EAP) is a program under which we release VersionPress for the first couple of versions. It explicitly marks the plugin as relatively immature, although we try to do as much testing before every release as possible. You can find the program details on the main [versionpress.net](http://versionpress.net/) website and **[join the program](http://versionpress.net/#get)** there, from the technical perspective there are the main points:

 - **Keep site backup at all times**. We really mean this. VersionPress revert operations manipulate the database and if there are any kind of issues the site may be left in a broken state. We try to do our best to prevent that but for EAP releases, backups are mandatory.

 - **Be familiar with WordPress and Git**. While the big promise of VersionPress is that it will be usable versioning solution for everyone, both technical and nontechnical people, it will be useful if you are familiar with Git and obviously also WordPress during the EAP period.

 - **Approach VersionPress with care**, especially when it comes to complex third-party plugins like e-commerce solutions, "page builders" etc. This is explained on the [external plugins](../feature-focus/external-plugins) page in more detail.

You can tell whether you are using an EAP release of VersionPress from the top admin area where there will be a clear EAP warning.

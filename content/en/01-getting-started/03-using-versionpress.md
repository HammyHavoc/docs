# Using VersionPress #

Lucky you, there isn't much to talk about here! Once VersionPress is installed and activated it will do its thing silently behind the scenes and you can basically forget about it.

When there is some kind of issue with the website, or when you just want to inspect what has happened in the past, using VersionPress is fairly simple:

1. Go to the VersionPress admin screen
2. Review the table with all the recent changes
3. Undo or Roll back to a previous state of the site

That's about it. You can find more details about various aspects of VersionPress in the *Feature Focus* section of these docs but for the basic scenarios, using VersionPress is really simple.

# Roadmap #

VersionPress is a long-term project. This page should give you an idea of where we are and what is planned for the future.

The list below is tentative without any subject to change any time but the sort order roughly represents our current priorities â€“ the higher up the list an item is, the higher chance it will be implemented sooner.

* Core versioning functionality. *(Shipped as part of [1.0-alpha1](./1.0-alpha1).)*
* Tracking of all the changes in a clean WordPress installation. *(Shipped as part of [1.0-alpha1](./1.0-alpha1).)*
* Selective Undo. *(Shipped as part of [1.0-alpha1](./1.0-alpha1).)*
* Complete rollback to a previous state of a site. *(Shipped as part of [1.0-alpha1](./1.0-alpha1).)*
* Synchronization functionality incl. support for staging / testing environment
* UI improvements (side-by-side diffs, better rendering of change details etc.)
* Explicit support for selected 3rd party plugins (some 3rd party plugins work out of the box, some won't and for the most popular ones, we'll be adding an explicit support)
* Lowering system requirements, e.g., not requiring Git on the server or supporting PHP 5.2
* Multisite
* Localization

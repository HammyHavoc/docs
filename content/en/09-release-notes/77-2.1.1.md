## New in 2.1.1

 - Fixed a bug that caused the clone command ended up with an error (#556).
 - Fixed a small bug in `restore-site` command (#555). The bug occurred only on Windows.


## Upgrade notes

2.1.1 is upgradable from [2.1](./2.1). Simply replace the plugin on your server.


## System requirements

General system requirements:

 - PHP 5.3.4 or later
 - WordPress 4.1 or later (should work on 3.9+ but it's only officially tested on 4.1+)
 - Git 1.9 or later
 - `proc_open()` enabled on the server

System requirements for sync / multi-instance workflows:

 - For 2.x, we recommend custom server / VPS as most hosting providers will pose further restrictions on creating site clones.

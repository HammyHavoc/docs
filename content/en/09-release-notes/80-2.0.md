# 2.0 Release Notes üç∏

VersionPress 2.0 brings the basics of the sync feature, new GUI stack, resolved db.php dependency issue and a handful of other things.

Released on [TODO]. Related blog posts: [TODO]


<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is an EAP release</strong>
  <p>Early Access is a period during which VersionPress is reasonably stable but still young, limited in scope and an external backup is recommended at all times. [Learn more about EAP](../getting-started/about-eap).</p>

## New in 2.0

 * **Synchronization between multiple environments**, implemented as a set of WP-CLI commands. `wp vp clone` clones a site to a new environment, `wp vp push` merges the changes back. There is also a `wp vp restore-site` command now, not entirely necessary for the sync workflows but closely related to that. 
 * **New GUI stack** built on top of technologies like React.js, WP REST API or TypeScript. As a result, the user interface will be much more flexible going forward. The new features include:
   * **Clickable table rows, showing details of every change**. In v1, one could only see a short message about a change like *Changed 5 options* without any more details. In v2, the row can be expanded which firstly displays an overview of the change, for example, the enumeration of the affected options, and upon clicking a button also the full diff which is a bit technical but displays all the details, including the values.
   * **UI for manual commits**. This is useful in scenarios where VersionPress couldn't commit the change automatically, e.g., after a FTP upload or after a manual change of a file on the disk. Git client needed to be used previously. 
   * **New commits notification**. If there are newer commits available on the server, the user is prompted to load them.
   * **Time markers in the main table are refreshed automatically**. A small thing but previously, you could see e.g. *"2 minutes ago"* next to a certain change for hours if you didn't refresh the table. In v2, the time markers automatically update.
   * Other minor UI updates like an "inline warning" about the need to fully activate VersionPress right inside the VersionPress row or the explanation why commits done pre-VersionPress-activation cannot be undone / rolled back to.
 * **Resolved db.php dependency**. VersionPress no longer requires db.php drop-in to be available, enabling compatibility with various caching, monitoring and other WordPress plugins.
 * WordPress **automatic background updates** are no longer affected by VersionPress. In v1, if VersionPress was activated, WordPress stopped doing background updates because it saw a `.git` folder in the site root and according to its default behavior it [assumed updates are handled by the user](https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates). This was not correct and we fixed it in v2. It now behaves this way:
   * If the site was being auto-updated before VersionPress was activated, we add a WP filter that ensures auto-updating keeps going.
   * If the user used manual version control before VersionPress was activated, we fall back to the default WP behavior and do not "force" background updates.   
 * Major **performance improvements during initial activation**. On some larger test sites, we saw dramatic improvements like the time necessary for the activation dropping from 130 to 4 seconds (!). Large sites will always be a challenge when it comes to activation (because all needs to be indexed at once) but at least we now do the indexing as efficiently as possible, or very close to that.
 * **Translations are now tracked** properly.
 * **Plugin compatibility is reported live in the plugins list**. When VersionPress is running it will add small indicators in the main plugins table and in the search/install page, utilizing the white- and black-lists available since 1.0-rc3.
 * **Smaller fixes / updates** to the automatic change tracking. Specifically:
   * Certain bulk changes better report what has changed.
   * WordPress update is no longer a "commit everything" operation, we try to be more selective about it (as we are with other types of changes). Also, there were rare cases where WP update could have been tracked as other kind of update, e.g., an options update, which has been fixed.
   * Some changes via the Customizer were not tracked correctly.
   * Menu changes tracked better.
 * **Internal format update**. It is a minor update, like changing about 1% of what we had and keeping the 99% untouched, but any update, however small, means that reverts beyond the update become problematic. That's why VersionPress 2.0 is not directly upgradable from 1.0. See notes on upgrade below.
 * **Compatibility fixes for WordPress 4.3**. Relatively minor but we've found and fixed a few issues, e.g. around favicons and menu updates in 4.3.


## System requirements

System requirements for VersionPress 2.0 are:

* PHP 5.3 or later
* WordPress 4.1 or later (should work on 3.9+ but it's only officially tested on 4.1+)
* Git 1.9 or later
* `proc_open()` enabled on the server


## Upgrade notes

VersionPress 2.0 is *not* upgradable from version 1.0, full re-activation is required. This is caused by an update to the internal data structures that, even though the changes are relatively minor, mean that VersionPress needs to start "fresh". *(Note: for post-EAP releases, we will have a migration mechanism when this happens but we do not have that yet; sorry for the inconvenience.)* The effect of re-activation is that the site history will be maintained in the Git repository but VersionPress will only be able to interact with the newly created commits; you can still use other Git clients to work with the history if you need to.

Upgrade procedure:

 1. Disable VersionPress 1.0
 2. Uninstall VersionPress 1.0 and install VersionPress 2.0
 3. Fully activate the plugin so that VersionPress tracks the site again

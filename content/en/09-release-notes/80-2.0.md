# 2.0 Release Notes

<div class="tip">
  <strong>2.0 has not been released yet</strong>
  <p>These are preliminary release notes for the upcoming VersionPress 2.0.</p>
</div>



VersionPress 2.0 brings the basics of the sync feature, new GUI stack, resolved db.php dependency issue and a handful of other things.

Released on [TODO]. Related blog posts: [TODO]


<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is an EAP release</strong>
  <p>Early Access is a period during which VersionPress is reasonably stable but still young, limited in scope and an external backup is recommended at all times. [Learn more about EAP](../getting-started/about-eap).</p>

## New in 2.0

 * **Synchronization between multiple environments** a.k.a. ***staging***, implemented as a set of WP-CLI commands. They are:

   * `vp clone` – creates a new site instance – a clone.
   * `vp pull` – pulls the changes back. Creates a merge commit if the two environments had concurrent changes.
   * `vp push` – pushes the changes to another clone. (Does not do a merge.)

    Also, these other useful WP-CLI commands have been added:

   * `vp restore-site` – when the only thing you have is a Git repository
   * `vp apply-changes` – refreshes database to reflect the current state of a site

    See the [Sync / Workflows section](../sync) for more.
 * **New GUI stack** built on top of technologies like React.js, WP REST API or TypeScript. As a result, the user interface is much more responsive and pleasant.
 * **New GUI features**, namely:
   * **Clickable table rows, showing details of every change**. The panel will first show a quick overview of changes (for example, a list of updated properties) with the option to show a full diff which is a bit technical but displays all the details (for example, the option values).
   * **UI for manual commits**. This is useful in scenarios where VersionPress couldn't commit the change automatically, e.g., after a FTP upload or after a manual change. 
   * **Notification of new commits**. If new commits are detected, a refresh link is displayed.
   * **Times in the main table refresh automatically** so they will now display correct time even if you don't refresh the page.
   * **Other minor UI updates** like an inline warning about the need to fully activate VersionPress or the explanation why commits done pre-activation cannot be undone / rolled back to.
 * **Resolved db.php dependency**. VersionPress no longer requires the `db.php` drop-in to be available, enabling compatibility with various caching, monitoring and other WordPress plugins.
 * **WordPress automatic background updates** are no longer affected by VersionPress. In v1, if VersionPress was activated, WordPress [stopped doing background updates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates). v2 maintains auto-updates if they were enabled before VersionPress activation.
 * **Fixes / updates in automatic change tracking**. Specifically:
   * The biggest one are **translations** which weren't tracked properly in v1.
   * Certain *bulk changes* now better report what has changed.
   * *WordPress update* is no longer a "commit everything" operation, we try to be more selective about it (as we are with other types of changes). Also, there were rare cases where WP update could have been tracked as other kind of update, e.g., an options update, which was fixed.
   * Some changes via the *Customizer* were not tracked correctly.
   * Improved *menu* change tracking.
 * **Internal format update**. We're changing how certain special characters are stored and also the options table will now use our "multi-file storage" which lowers the chance of merge conflicts during the sync scenarios. The updates are not huge but mean that VersionPress 2.0 will not be upgradable from 1.0 – see notes on that below.
 * **Plugin compatibility is reported live in the plugins list**. When VersionPress is running, it will add indicators in the main plugins table and in the search/install page, utilizing the white- and black-lists available since [1.0-rc3](./1.0-rc3).
 * **Major performance improvements during the initial activation**. On some larger test sites, we saw dramatic improvements like the time necessary for the activation dropping down from 130 to 4 seconds. Large sites will always be a challenge when it comes to activation (because all needs to be indexed at once) but at least we now do the indexing as efficiently as possible, or very close to that.
 * **Compatibility fixes for WordPress 4.3**. Relatively minor but we've found and fixed a few issues around favicons and menu updates.
 

## System requirements

General system requirements:

 - PHP 5.3.4 or later
 - WordPress 4.1 or later (should work on 3.9+ but it's only officially tested on 4.1+)
 - Git 1.9 or later
 - `proc_open()` enabled on the server

System requirements for sync / multi-instance workflows:

 - For 2.0, we recommend custom server / VPS as most hosting providers will pose further restrictions on creating site clones.


## Upgrade notes

VersionPress 2.0 is *not* upgradable from version 1.0, full re-activation is required. This will keep your changes in the Git repository but VersionPress will not be able to undo and rollback those changes (you can still use Git clients to work with your site's history).

To upgrade VersionPress:

 1. Disable VersionPress 1.0
 2. Uninstall VersionPress 1.0
 3. Install VersionPress 2.0
 3. Fully activate the plugin so that VersionPress tracks the site again

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is an EAP release</strong>
  <p>Early Access is a period during which VersionPress is reasonably stable but still young, limited in scope and an external backup is recommended at all times. [Learn more about EAP](../getting-started/about-eap).</p>

## New in 2.0



## System requirements

System requirements for VersionPress 2.0 are:

* PHP 5.3 or later
* WordPress 4.1 or later (should work on 3.9+ but it's only officially tested on 4.1+)
* Git 1.9 or later
* `proc_open()` enabled on the server


## Upgrade notes

VersionPress 2.0 is *not* upgradable from version 1.0, full re-activation is required. This is caused by an update to the internal data structures that, even though the changes are relatively minor, mean that VersionPress needs to start "fresh". *(Note: for post-EAP releases, we will have a migration mechanism when this happens but we do not have that yet; sorry for the inconvenience.)* The effect of re-activation is that the site history will be maintained in the Git repository but VersionPress will only be able to interact with the newly created commits; you can still use other Git clients to work with the history if you need to.

Upgrade procedure:

 1. Disable VersionPress 1.0
 2. Uninstall VersionPress 1.0 and install VersionPress 2.0
 3. Fully activate the plugin so that VersionPress tracks the site again

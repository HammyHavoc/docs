## Upgrade notes

VersionPress 3.0 is not auto-upgradable from 2.x or any previous releases, full re-activation is required. The recommended procedure is:

 1. Put the site under maintenance mode
 2. Deactivate VersionPress (just deactivate, do not uninstall)
 3. Delete the contents of `wp-content/plugins/versionpress` and extract the current version of VersionPress there
 4. Activate & initialize the plugin again
 5. Disable the maintenance mode


## System requirements

General system requirements:

 - PHP 5.6.0 or later
 - WordPress 4.4 or later
 - Git 1.9 or later
 - `proc_open()` enabled on the server

System requirements for sync / multi-instance workflows:

 - For 3.0, we recommend custom server / VPS as most hosting providers will pose further restrictions on creating site clones.

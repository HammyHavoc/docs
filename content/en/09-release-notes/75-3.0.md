VersionPress 3.0 is a major usability and reliability release.

Released on XX March 2016.


<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is an EAP release</strong>
  <p>Early Access is a period during which VersionPress is reasonably stable but still young, limited in scope and an external backup is recommended at all times. [Learn more about EAP](../getting-started/about-eap).</p>

## New in 3.0

### UI / usability improvements

- **Filtering & searching in the main table** (#586). Site histories can be long and complex so we've introduced a search / filter box similarly to what you can find in your Gmail or GitHub Issues. It supports several operators such as:
    - [TODO when the ticket is finished]
- **Undo a selection of commits** (#201). Sometimes, it's useful to undo a selection, or a range of commits in on go. There's now a way to do that easily from the UI. [TODO when the ticket is finished] 
- **Changes done via Customizer produce much nicer messages** (#432). Previously, all the changes done via Customizer were captured as a generic *"Customized theme XYZ"*. Now, you will see much more useful messages like *"Updated title ..."*, *"Updated menu ..."* etc.
- **Notification system** (#215). [TODO when the ticket is finished]
- **Visualization in which environment the commit originated** (#609, #459). Imagine you have a production site and a staging site. You can now see which commit came from where. [TODO when the ticket is finished] 
- **Service panel updated** (#732). [TODO when the ticket is finished]


### Core versioning improvements

- **Date modified handled correctly** (#588). This is a great example of a seemingly simple thing that can turn out to be a huge challenge for VersionPress. In the early days, we quickly discovered that Git creates merge conflicts on `post_modified` and `post_modified_gmt` fields for every change of a post so we decided not to store these fields in our data and compute it from the Git history. This seemed to worked great, however, we didn't realize that there might be posts created *before* VersionPress was activated and this method didn't work for them at all. So in 3.0, we needed to start tracking the `post_modified` field *and* avoid a merge conflict at the same time. This lead to implementing our own merge driver that handles this but also gave us the opportunity to handle the following point:
- **Changes on adjacent lines no longer conflict** (#719). By default, Git sees changes on adjacent lines as a conflict so for example if you update a `post_title` and someone else updates a `post_content`, Git sees that as a conflict which is not correct in our situation. Our merge driver prevents these conflicts.
- **Shortcodes with IDs work across environments** (#654). If there's a shortcode like `[gallery ids="2,3,4"]` somewhere, VersionPress will now correctly translated the IDs to universally unique IDs so that they work across environments (and during reverts). We needed to introduce a new `*-shortcodes.yml` file format that describes the shortcodes for VersionPress, similarly to how `*-schema.yml` describe the database. (BTW, we switched from NEON to YAML, see below.)
- **Frequent DB writes** (#512). [TODO]
- **Configurable entity ignoring** (#511). [TODO]
- **Initial support for custom directory layouts** (#565). [TODO]
- **Data updates via `query()` are now understood** (#510). [TODO when the ticket is finished]


### Other notable changes

- Got rid of `vpconfig.neon` in favor of `wp-config.php` ‚Äì #566
- Got rid of NEON file format, replaced with YAML (#703)
- PHP 5.6 or 7.0 is required ‚Äì #726


### Other changes

[TODO]


## Upgrade notes

VersionPress 3.0 is not auto-upgradable from 2.x or any previous releases, full re-activation is required. The recommended procedure is:

 1. Put the site under maintenance mode
 2. Deactivate VersionPress (just deactivate, do not uninstall)
 3. Delete the contents of `wp-content/plugins/versionpress` and extract the current version of VersionPress there
 4. Activate & initialize the plugin again
 5. Disable the maintenance mode


## System requirements

General system requirements:

 - PHP 5.6.0 or later
 - WordPress 4.4 or later
 - Git 1.9 or later
 - `proc_open()` enabled on the server

System requirements for sync / multi-instance workflows:

 - For 3.0, we recommend custom server / VPS as most hosting providers will pose further restrictions on creating site clones.

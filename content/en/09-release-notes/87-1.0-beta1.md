<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is a beta release</strong>
  <p>Beta means approximate feature completeness but bugs might still be there and production use is strongly discouraged. Always have a proper backup solution if you decide to use VersionPress at this stage.</p>

## Release details ##

Highlights of this release are:

* **Improved versioning for a couple of things**, for example post-meta.
* **Better Git commit messages**, useful for power users. 
* **Easy issue reporting**. When there is a problem it can be reported easily using a new service panel above the main VersionPress table. Things like logs, basic info about the environment etc. are reported for more efficient issue resolving.
* **Main table paging**. An obvious feature for 1.0, if there are many commits the main table must display page navigation.
* **Future-proofing** for the sync functionality and other areas. Though the sync functionality (team work, multiple environments etc.) is currently scheduled to ship only as part of 2.0, we needed to do some ground work in 1.0 so that all works even for older commits when 2.0 eventually ships.
* Changed location of the internal `db` folder so that it better supports future VersionPress updates. This means that there is no direct upgrade path from 1.0-alpha3.
* Fixed a lot of bugs since alpha3.
* Improved the docs site with features like navigation to prev/next topic.

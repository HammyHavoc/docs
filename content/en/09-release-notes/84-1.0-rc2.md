Released on XX-Feb-2015.


<div class="note">
  <strong>Note: this is a preview release</strong>
  <p>Release Candidate means that it contains all the planned features for the release and that the stability is quite good. However, not all items on our task list are checked yet so still still qualifies as a preview release.</p>

## Release details

Highlights of this release are:

 - **Updated internal storage format**. This is a very important change, and a breaking one in a sense – there will be no upgrade path from 1.0 RC1 to newer releases. (There has been some internal discussion whether we should implement a system for "migrations" when changes like this occur and it will probably done one day but it is a major task and our EAP members decided that proper migration was not that important at this point.)
 - **Initial support for large sites**. WordPress installations that contain thousands of entities like posts or users pose a special challenge for VersionPress, and while we focus on the more common, "average" scenarios for v1 we made sure that we will be able to support such large sites in the future. So far, the support has been done on the lowest level, see the updated internal storage format, which will now easily support sites with hundreds of thousands of entities. Next we need to find a way for such sites to actually initialize in VersionPress which will come in some future release.
 - **Popup before Undo / Rollback**. Related to the previous point, we now display a popup window before the revert action is run to provide some more information about this process.
 - **Pre-revert check for clean working directory**. When a custom change like manually edited theme file is recognized on the file system, revert is not allowed (would take this change with it which is usually not what the user wanted).
 - **Better two-way "foreign key" checking on reverts**. In previous versions we had checks towards "parent" entities, for example, when reverting a post deletion, it was checked that the user owning the post still existed. What we check now are also "child" entities, for example, if the post creation is being reverted, it is now checked that there are no comments to that post (revert would have "orphaned" them).
 - **Optimized db synchronization** – only the affected tables are worked with now (used to update the whole WP database)
 - **More standard error handling / logging**. Up until now we captured all sorts of errors and even replaced HTTP 500 error page which was useful for debugging but not in line with how WordPress error handling / logging should work. That is fixed now.
 - **WP-CLI script for site recovery**. VersionPress was always designed so that it can recover the website from just a Git repository (i.e., no database), however, we didn't have a clean script to do that. That changed in this release.
 - New **system info page** for troubleshooting
 - **Customizable Git binary** – if the default `git` command doesn't work for some reason the full path to the binary can now be specified using the new "vpconfig" mechanism.
 - **Priorities for options** so that the change message is more natural most of the time.
 - **Written many automated tests**. This is a task that has been going on for months and with RC2, we finally have a test suite that covers both the high-level scenarios using Selenium tests and some of the core functionality like db-to-files serialization with unit tests.
 - **Git 1.8 is now supported**. This is an old Git version, released in 2012, but some users can't use anything newer on their host so we ran our test suite (see!) using the 1.8 Git version and all seems to be working fine. Some more recent version is still obviously recommended.
 - Commits now contain `X-VP-Version` tag
 - Minor improvements to automatic change tracking


## Usage notes

System requirements for this release are:

* PHP 5.3 or later
* WordPress 3.9 or later (latest release recommended)
* Git **1.8** or later (change since RC1 which required 1.9)


### Upgrade from previous versions 

**There is no upgrade path from previous versions**, sorry. You have to deactivate VersionPress, upload the new version and fully reactivate again. The site history will still be captured in the old format but will not be actionable – there will be no way to revert to it, etc. This is due to the change of the internal storage format, see above. 


## Known issues ##

 - Reverts are slow on sites with many entities. This will be improved in some future update.
 - A couple of minor issues in automatic change tracking are still left and will be fixed in the final 1.0 release.

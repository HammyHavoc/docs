## EAP releases

Early Access Program (EAP) provides access to VersionPress releases but at the same time marks them as early and somewhat experimental. You can read about our motivation for the program [in this blog post](http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/01/announcing-early-access-program/) and [**join the program** here](http://versionpress.net/#get).

This applies to all EAP releases, both preview versions (those marked as `alpha`, `beta` or `rc`) and stable ones (`1.0`, `2.0` etc.):

 - The software has **known limitations** in what scenarios it supports, what hosts it can run on, which 3<sup>rd</sup> party plugins are supported, etc.
 - We recommend having a **separate backup solution** in place so that if anything goes wrong with VersionPress, you have a safe way back.


## Release versioning

VersionPress releases are marked so that it's easy to understand what to expect of the release. Here is a couple of rules we follow:

 - VersionPress generally **bumps a major version number with every release**, so while WordPress uses a sequence like `4.1`, `4.2`, `4.3` etc., we will generally use `4.0`, `5.0`, `6.0` etc., similarly to modern web browsers.
 - **Minor releases**, e.g., `4.1`, with minor feature changes can happen but we generally aim to avoid them
 - **Patch releases** use the third segment of version identifier, e.g., `4.0.1`. We aim to avoid them too :-)
 - **Preview versions** are marked with labels like `4.0-alpha1`, `4.0-beta1`, `4.0-rc` and similar. Prerelease names have their well-defined meaning:
     - **Alpha** means that we are not feature complete yet and that there *will* be bugs, possibly even severe ones. Never use an alpha release on a production site, with production database or generally with data you care for.
     - **Beta** means that we are feature complete for the given release and relatively stable but running such version with production data is still not recommended. Never operate VersionPress beta without proper backups.
     - **RC (Release Candidate)** is close to the final / stable version 

Versions are compared and ordered by the same rules that [semver](http://semver.org/) uses (versions with two segments only like 1.0 are effectively 1.0.0 for comparison's sake).

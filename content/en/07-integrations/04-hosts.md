# Hosts

As described on the [installation page](../getting-started/installation-uninstallation), VersionPress has stricter system requirements than vanilla WordPress – specifically, we require Git on the server and `proc_open()` enabled. This is for [good reasons](../feature-focus/git) but also means that hosting is a bit of a challenge. Most of our early users run VersionPress on dedicated servers or VPS's that allow complete control and that's still recommended, however, there are also a couple of shared hosts that fully support VersionPress today.

## Supported hosts

Here are a couple of hosts that we or our users confirmed work fine with VersionPress:

 - [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/) - a popular WordPress host
 - [FastComet](http://www.fastcomet.com/) - SSD cloud hosting with CloudFlare & 24/7 Premium Support
 - [Byte](https://www.byte.nl/) - performance webhosting in Netherlands

 - [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/) - German hosting company (have Git 1.7 pre-installed, upgradable to 1.9+) 



## Unsupported hosts

Here are some of the hosts that don't support VersionPress at the moment. If you are their customer, **please let them know**. If they see more demand for VersionPress they might add support for it.

 - WP Engine – they have intentionally restricted environment that doesn't allow `proc_open()`. We acknowledge that WPE is important to our users and are actively looking into how to possibly support it.
 - DreamHost
 - FlyWheel – they don't have Git installed

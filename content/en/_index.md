# VersionPress Documentation #

Welcome to [VersionPress](http://versionpress.net/) documentation. VersionPress itself is intuitive to use but some things like core concepts or installation details require more attention and are described here.

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>
  <p>VersionPress is currently in its pre-release stage and these docs, like everything else, are preliminary and will improve over time.</p>
</div>

These docs are divided into a couple of sections:

* [Getting Started](./en/getting-started) – brief introduction to VersionPress
* [Feature Focus](./en/feature-focus) – discusses most important feature areas in more detail
* [Release Notes](./en/release-note) – details of all releases

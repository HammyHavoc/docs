# VersionPress-docs #

Content of user documentation.


## Note about Git branches

These docs use Git branches to reflect product branches â€“ for example, the `1.0-beta1` VersionPress release has its contents living in the `1.0-beta1` branch of this repository.

The `master` branch should follow the latest version. For example, if the latest version is `2.0`, do this:

     git symbolic-ref refs/heads/master refs/heads/2.0

Note that you need to execute this command manually on every clone of the repo.


## How to author the docs

See the [wiki](http://wiki.agilio.cz/versionpress:dokumentace#uzivatelska-dokumentace).


## How to test and deploy

Authoring and visually testing the documentation is simple:

1. Make sure that in the local folder structure, the `VersionPress-docs` and `VersionPress-docssite` folders sit side by side (and that they are named exactly this).
2. Install Node.js + NPM + Gulp + run `npm install` inside `VersionPress-docs`
3. Run `gulp watch`
4. Open the *VersionPress-docssite* project in Visual Studio and run it (Ctrl+F5)
5. Change the Markdown files as you wish, the content will be automatically copied to the test site (as long as `gulp watch` is running).

When the site is ready for deployment:

1. Stop gulp watch
2. Run plain `gulp` (it creates the `.changed` file in the destination again which is vital)
3. Use the *Publish...* wizard with the preconfigured `versionpress-docs` profile to push the contents to the server

Also, when the publish accompanies a **new version**, pay attention to [all the things that should be done on version bump](http://wiki.agilio.cz/versionpress:dokumentace#pripravit-veci-pro-dalsi-verzi).
